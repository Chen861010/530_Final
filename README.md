## Solar Pumping Microgrid - Description and Overview
This microgrid project includes non-grid supplied power systems for 
domestic water supply and electrical lighting serving a small community
in Uganda.

In Uganda clean, potable water is often attained from vertical boreholes 
where aquifers are available. Hand pump kiosks allow for manual extraction of 
water but this is not effective for larger communities where
community members face long wait times (figure 1).

This microgrid project develops electric power to pump domestic water
from a borehole to a water storage tank. Figure 2 shows a general solar 
pumping diagram.

Microgrid design parameters for our community are based on an 
Engineering Without Borders 2020 implementation report by the Penn State 
University chapter of Engineers Without Borders. The chapter worked with 
the community of Namutamba for several years to understand design requirements 
such as daily water volume requirements and water storage. 

Water storage is required for buffering against cloudy days when the microgrid 
power source for water pumping is not available.

This microgrid project includes electrical power and electrical storage 
requirements to serve a small school house. Electrical stroage is required 
for inclement weather where daily power resources fall below average. 

Microgrid projects (non-grid tied) with similar designs are
implemented by Engineers Without Borders chapters in a number of African
countries. Figure 3 shows solar projects in Uganda and Kenya where each 
colored circle indicates a solar installation. Reasons for solar 
adoption are solar can be more reliable than grid power, less expensive 
than grid power, and solar can be erected where needed.

Satellite images (figure 4) show large open areas that favor solar 
installation sites. The community is low density with few structurs and land 
use includes agriculture. The Pen State University chapter has completed
reports describing the demographic and socioeconomic profiles for
the community.

#### The community is located at:  
  * latitude:  0.5345
  * longitude: 32.0877
